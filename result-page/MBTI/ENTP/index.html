          <h2>ENTP - The visionary</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>As an ENTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via
            your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically.</p>
          <p>With Extraverted Intuition dominating their personality, the ENTP's primary interest in life is
            understanding the world that they live in. They are constantly absorbing ideas and images about the
            situations they are presented in their lives. Using their intuition to process this information, they are usually
            extremely quick and accurate in their ability to size up a situation. With the exception of their ENFP
            cousin, the ENTP has a deeper understanding of their environment than any of the other types.</p>
          <p>This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts the ENTP at a distinct advantage in their
            lives. They generally understand things quickly and with great depth. Accordingly, they are quite flexible
            and adapt well to a wide range of tasks. They are good at most anything that interests them. As they grow
            and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they become very aware of possibilities, and this
            makes them quite resourceful when solving problems.</p>
          <p>ENTP's are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see possibilities everywhere. They get
            excited and enthusiastic about their ideas, and are able to spread their enthusiasm to others. In this way,
            they get the support that they need to fulfill their visions.</p>
          <p>ENTP’s are less interested in developing plans of actions or making decisions than they are in generating
            possibilities and ideas. Following through on the implementation of an idea is usually a chore to the ENTP.
            For some ENTP’s, this results in the habit of never finishing what they start. The ENTP who has not
            developed their Thinking process will have problems with jumping enthusiastically from idea to idea,
            without following through on their plans. The ENTP needs to take care to think through their ideas fully in
            order to take advantage of them.</p>
          <p>The ENTP's auxiliary process of Introverted Thinking drives their decision making process. Although the
            ENTP is more interested in absorbing information than in making decisions, they are quite rational and
            logical in reaching conclusions. When they apply Thinking to their Intuitive perceptions, the outcome can
            be very powerful indeed. A well-developed ENTP is extremely visionary, inventive, and enterprising.</p>
          <p>ENTP’s are fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy verbal sparring with others. They love to
            debate issues, and may even switch sides sometimes just for the love of the debate. When they express their
            underlying principles, however, they may feel awkward and speak abruptly and intensely.</p>
          <p>The ENTP personality type is sometimes referred to the "Lawyer" type. The ENTP "lawyer" quickly and
            accurately understands a situation, and objectively and logically acts upon the situation. Their Thinking
            side makes their actions and decisions based on an objective list of rules or laws. If the ENTP was
            defending someone who had actually committed a crime, they are likely to take advantage of quirks in the
            law that will get their client off the hook. If they were to actually win the case, they would see their actions
            as completely fair and proper to the situation, because their actions were lawful. The guilt or innocence of
            their client would not be as relevant. If this type of reasoning goes incompletely unchecked by the ENTP, it
            could result in a character that is perceived by others as unethical or even dishonest. The ENTP, who does
            not naturally consider the more personal or human element in decision making, should take care to notice
            the subjective, personal side of situations. This is a potential problem are for ENTP’s. Although their
            logical abilities lend strength and purpose to the ENTP, they may also isolate them from their feelings and
            from other people.</p>
          <p>The least developed area for the ENTP is the Sensing-Feeling arena. If the Sensing areas are neglected, the
            ENTP may tend to not take care of details in their life. If their Feeling part is neglected, the ENTP may not
            value other people's input enough, or may become overly harsh and aggressive.</p>
          <p>Under stress, the ENTP may lose their ability to generate possibilities, and become obsessed with minor
            details. These details may seem to be extremely important to the ENTP, but in reality are usually not
            important to the big picture.</p>
          <p>In general, ENTP’s are upbeat visionaries. They highly value knowledge, and spend much of their lives
            seeking a higher understanding. They live in the world of possibilities, and become excited about concepts,
            challenges and difficulties. When presented with a problem, they're good at improvising and quickly come
            up with a creative solution. Creative, clever, curious, and theoretical, ENTP’s have a broad range of
            possibilities in their lives.</p>
