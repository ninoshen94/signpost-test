          <h2>INFP - The idealist</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>As an INFP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with
            things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your personal value
            system. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in primarily via your
            intuition.</p>
          <p>INFP's, more than other iNtuitive Feeling types, are focused on making the world a better
            place for people. Their primary goal is to find out their meaning in life. What is their
            purpose? How can they best serve humanity in their lives? They are idealists and
            perfectionists, who drive themselves hard in their quest for achieving the goals they have
            identified for themselves</p>
          <p>INFP’s are highly intuitive about people. They rely heavily on their intuitions to guide
            them, and use their discoveries to constantly search for value in life. They are on a
            continuous mission to find the truth and meaning underlying things. Every encounter and
            every piece of knowledge gained gets sifted through the INFP's value system, and is
            evaluated to see if it has any potential to help the INFP define or refine their own path in
            life. The goal at the end of the path is always the same - the INFP is driven to help people
            and make the world a better place.</p>
          <p>Generally thoughtful and considerate, INFP’s are good listeners and put people at ease.
            Although they may be reserved in expressing emotion, they have a very deep well of
            caring and are genuinely interested in understanding people. This sincerity is sensed by
            others, making the INFP a valued friend and confidante. An INFP can be quite warm
            with people he or she knows well.</p>
          <p>INFP’s do not like conflict, and go to great lengths to avoid it. If they must face it, they
            will always approach it from the perspective of their feelings. In conflict situations,
            INFP’s place little importance on who is right and who is wrong. They focus on the way
            that the conflict makes them feel, and indeed don't really care whether or not they're right.
            They don't want to feel badly. This trait sometimes makes them appear irrational and
            illogical in conflict situations. On the other hand, INFP’s make very good mediators, and
            are typically good at solving other people's conflicts, because they intuitively understand
            people's perspectives and feelings, and genuinely want to help them.</p>
          <p>INFP’s are flexible and laid-back, until one of their values is violated. In the face of their
            value system being threatened, INFP’s can become aggressive defenders, fighting
            passionately for their cause. When an INFP has adopted a project or job which they're
            interested in, it usually becomes a "cause" for them. Although they are not detail-oriented
            individuals, they will cover every possible detail with determination and vigor when
            working for their "cause".</p>
          <p>When it comes to the mundane details of life maintenance, INFP’s are typically
            completely unaware of such things. They might go for long periods without noticing a
            stain on the carpet, but carefully and meticulously brush a speck of dust off of their
            project booklet.</p>
          <p>INFP’s do not like to deal with hard facts and logic. Their focus on their feelings and the
            Human Condition makes it difficult for them to deal with impersonal judgment. They
            don't understand or believe in the validity of impersonal judgment, which makes them
            naturally rather ineffective at using it. Most INFP’s will avoid impersonal analysis,
            although some have developed this ability and are able to be quite logical. Under stress,
            it's not uncommon for INFP’s to misuse hard logic in the heat of anger, throwing out fact
            after (often inaccurate) fact in an emotional outburst.</p>
          <p>INFP’s have very high standards and are perfectionists. Consequently, they are usually
            hard on themselves, and don't give themselves enough credit. INFP’s may have problems
            working on a project in a group, because their standards are likely to be higher than other
            members' of the group. In group situations, they may have a "control" problem. The INFP
            needs to work on balancing their high ideals with the requirements of every day living.
            Without resolving this conflict, they will never be happy with themselves, and they may
            become confused and paralyzed about what to do with their lives.</p>
          <p>INFP’s are usually talented writers. They may be awkward and uncomfortable with
            expressing themselves verbally, but have a wonderful ability to define and express what
            they're feeling on paper. INFP’s also appear frequently in social service professions, such
            as counseling or teaching. They are at their best in situations where they're working
            towards the public good, and in which they don't need to use hard logic.</p>
          <p>INFP’s who function in their well-developed sides can accomplish great and wonderful
            things, which they will rarely give themselves credit for. Some of the great, humanistic
            catalysts in the world have been INFP’s.</p>
