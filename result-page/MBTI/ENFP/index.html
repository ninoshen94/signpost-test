          <h2>ENFP - The inspirer</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>As an ENFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via
            your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel
            about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system.</p>
          <p>ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of
            possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the
            ability to inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk their way in or out
            of anything. They love life, seeing it as a special gift, and strive to make the most out of it.</p>
          <p>ENFPs have an unusually broad range of skills and talents. They are good at most things which interest
            them. Project-oriented, they may go through several different careers during their lifetime. To onlookers,
            the ENFP may seem directionless and without purpose, but ENFPs are actually quite consistent, in that they
            have a strong sense of values which they live with throughout their lives. Everything that they do must be
            in line with their values. An ENFP needs to feel that they are living their lives as their true Self, walking in
            step with what they believe is right. They see meaning in everything, and are on a continuous quest to adapt
            their lives and values to achieve inner peace. They're constantly aware and somewhat fearful of losing
            touch with themselves. Since emotional excitement is usually an important part of the ENFP's life, and
            because they are focused on keeping "centered", the ENFP is usually an intense individual, with highly
            evolved values.</p>
          <p>An ENFP needs to focus on following through with their projects. This can be a problem area for some of
            these individuals. Unlike other Extraverted types, ENFPs need time alone to center themselves, and make
            sure they are moving in a direction which is in sync with their values. ENFPs who remain centered will
            usually be quite successful at their endeavors. Others may fall into the habit of dropping a project when
            they become excited about a new possibility, and thus they never achieve the great accomplishments which
            they are capable of achieving.</p>
          <p>Most ENFPs have great people skills. They are genuinely warm and interested in people, and place great
            importance on their inter-personal relationships. ENFPs almost always have a strong need to be liked.
            Sometimes, especially at a younger age, an ENFP will tend to be "gushy" and insincere, and generally
            "overdo" in an effort to win acceptance. However, once an ENFP has learned to balance their need to be
            true to themselves with their need for acceptance, they excel at bringing out the best in others, and are
            typically well-liked. They have an exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short
            period of time, and use their intuition and flexibility to relate to others on their own level.</p>
          <p>Because ENFPs live in the world of exciting possibilities, the details of everyday life are seen as trivial
            drudgery. They place no importance on detailed, maintenance-type tasks, and will frequently remain
            oblivious to these types of concerns. When they do have to perform these tasks, they do not enjoy
            themselves. This is a challenging area of life for most ENFPs, and can be frustrating for ENFP's family
            members.</p>
          <p>An ENFP who has "gone wrong" may be quite manipulative - and very good it. The gift of gab which they
            are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get what they want. Most ENFPs will not abuse their
            abilities, because that would not jive with their value systems.</p>
          <p>ENFPs sometimes make serious errors in judgment. They have an amazing ability to intuitively perceive
            the truth about a person or situation, but when they apply judgment to their perception, they may jump to
            the wrong conclusions.</p>
          <p>ENFPs who have not learned to follow through may have a difficult time remaining happy in marital
            relationships. Always seeing the possibilities of what could be, they may become bored with what actually
            is. The strong sense of values will keep many ENFPs dedicated to their relationships. However, ENFPs like
            a little excitement in their lives, and are best matched with individuals who are comfortable with change
            and new experiences.</p>
          <p>Having an ENFP parent can be a fun-filled experience, but may be stressful at times for children with
            strong Sensing or Judging tendencies. Such children may see the ENFP parent as inconsistent and difficult
            to understand, as the children are pulled along in the whirlwind life of the ENFP. Sometimes the ENFP will
            want to be their child's best friend, and at other times they will play the parental authoritarian. But ENFPs
            are always consistent in their value systems, which they will impress on their children above all else, along
            with a basic joy of living.</p>
          <p>ENFPs are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined to strict schedules
            or mundane tasks. Consequently, ENFPs work best in situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and
            where they can work with people and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to
            be quite productive with little supervision, as long as they are excited about what they're doing.
            Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments, ENFPs often suffer from
            muscle tension. They have a strong need to be independent, and resist being controlled or labeled. They
            need to maintain control over themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their dislike of
            dependence and suppression extends to others as well as to themselves.</p>
          <p>ENFPs are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented individuals with capabilities
            ranging across a broad spectrum. They have many gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those
            near them, if they are able to remain centered and master the ability of following through.</p>
