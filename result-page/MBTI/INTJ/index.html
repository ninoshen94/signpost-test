          <h2>INTJ - The scientist</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>As an INTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in
            primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things
            rationally and logically.</p>
          <p>INTJ's live in the world of ideas and strategic planning. They value intelligence,
            knowledge, and competence, and typically have high standards in these regards, which
            they continuously strive to fulfill. To a somewhat lesser extent, they have similar
            expectations of others.</p>
          <p>With Introverted Intuition dominating their personality, INTJ’s focus their energy on
            observing the world, and generating ideas and possibilities. Their mind constantly gathers
            information and makes associations about it. They are tremendously insightful and
            usually are very quick to understand new ideas. However, their primary interest is not
            understanding a concept, but rather applying that concept in a useful way. Unlike the
            INTP, they do not follow an idea as far as they possibly can, seeking only to understand it
            fully. INTJ’s are driven to come to conclusions about ideas. Their need for closure and
            organization usually requires that they take some action.</p>
          <p>INTJ's tremendous value and need for systems and organization, combined with their
            natural insightfulness, makes them excellent scientists. An INTJ scientist gives a gift to
            society by putting their ideas into a useful form for others to follow. It is not easy for the
            INTJ to express their internal images, insights, and abstractions. The internal form of the
            INTJ's thoughts and concepts is highly individualized, and is not readily translatable into
            a form that others will understand. However, the INTJ is driven to translate their ideas
            into a plan or system that is usually readily explainable, rather than to do a direct
            translation of their thoughts. They usually don't see the value of a direct transaction, and
            will also have difficulty expressing their ideas, which are non-linear. However, their
            extreme respect of knowledge and intelligence will motivate them to explain themselves
            to another person who they feel is deserving of the effort.</p>
          <p>INTJ’s are natural leaders, although they usually choose to remain in the background
            until they see a real need to take over the lead. When they are in leadership roles, they are
            quite effective, because they are able to objectively see the reality of a situation, and are
            adaptable enough to change things which aren't working well. They are the supreme
            strategists - always scanning available ideas and concepts and weighing them against
            their current strategy, to plan for every conceivable contingency.</p>
          <p>INTJ’s spend a lot of time inside their own minds, and may have little interest in the other
            people's thoughts or feelings. Unless their Feeling side is developed, they may have
            problems giving other people the level of intimacy that is needed. Unless their Sensing
            side is developed, they may have a tendency to ignore details which are necessary for
            implementing their ideas.</p>
          <p>The INTJ's interest in dealing with the world is to make decisions, express judgments,
            and put everything that they encounter into an understandable and rational system.
            Consequently, they are quick to express judgments. Often they have very evolved
            intuitions, and are convinced that they are right about things. Unless they complement
            their intuitive understanding with a well-developed ability to express their insights, they
            may find themselves frequently misunderstood. In these cases, INTJ’s tend to blame
            misunderstandings on the limitations of the other party, rather than on their own difficulty
            in expressing themselves. This tendency may cause the INTJ to dismiss others input too
            quickly, and to become generally arrogant and elitist.</p>
          <p>INTJ’s are ambitious, self-confident, deliberate, long-range thinkers. Many INTJ’s end
            up in engineering or scientific pursuits, although some find enough challenge within the
            business world in areas which involve organizing and strategic planning. They dislike
            messiness and inefficiency, and anything that is muddled or unclear. They value clarity
            and efficiency, and will put enormous amounts of energy and time into consolidating
            their insights into structured patterns.</p>
          <p>Other people may have a difficult time understanding an INTJ. They may see them as
            aloof and reserved. Indeed, the INTJ is not overly demonstrative of their affections, and
            is likely to not give as much praise or positive support as others may need or desire. That
            doesn't mean that he or she doesn't truly have affection or regard for others, they simply
            do not typically feel the need to express it. Others may falsely perceive the INTJ as being
            rigid and set in their ways. Nothing could be further from the truth, because the INTJ is
            committed to always finding the objective best strategy to implement their ideas. The
            INTJ is usually quite open to hearing an alternative way of doing something.</p>
          <p>When under a great deal of stress, the INTJ may become obsessed with mindless
            repetitive, sensate activities, such as over-drinking. They may also tend to become
            absorbed with minutia and details that they would not normally consider important to
            their overall goal.</p>
          <p>INTJ’s need to remember to express themselves sufficiently, so as to avoid difficulties
            with people misunderstandings. In the absence of properly developing their
            communication abilities, they may become abrupt and short with people, and
            isolationists.</p>
          <p>INTJ’s have a tremendous amount of ability to accomplish great things. They have
            insight into the Big Picture, and are driven to synthesize their concepts into solid plans of
            action. Their reasoning skills give them the means to accomplish that. INTJ’s are most
            always highly competent people, and will not have a problem meeting their career or
            education goals. They have the capability to make great strides in these arenas. On a
            personal level, the INTJ who practices tolerances and puts effort into effectively
            communicating their insights to others has everything in his or her power to lead a rich
            and rewarding life.</p>
