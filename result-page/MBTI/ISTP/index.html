          <h2>ISTP - The mechanic</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>As an ISTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with
            things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things
            in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.</p>
          <p>ISTP's have a compelling drive to understand the way things work. They're good at
            logical analysis, and like to use it on practical concerns. They typically have strong
            powers of reasoning, although they're not interested in theories or concepts unless they
            can see a practical application. They like to take things apart and see the way they work.</p>
          <p>ISTP’s have an adventuresome spirit. They are attracted to motorcycles, airplanes, sky
            diving, surfing, etc. They thrive on action, and are usually fearless. ISTP’s are fiercely
            independent, needing to have the space to make their own decisions about their next step.
            They do not believe in or follow rules and regulations, as this would prohibit their ability
            to "do their own thing". Their sense of adventure and desire for constant action makes
            ISTP’s prone to becoming bored rather quickly.</p>
          <p>ISTP’s are loyal to their causes and beliefs, and are firm believers that people should be
            treated with equity and fairness. Although they do not respect the rules of the "System",
            they follow their own rules and guidelines for behavior faithfully. They will not take part
            in something which violates their personal laws. ISTP’s are extremely loyal and faithful
            to their "brothers".</p>
          <p>ISTP’s like and need to spend time alone, because this is when they can sort things out in
            their minds most clearly. They absorb large quantities of impersonal facts from the
            external world, and sort through those facts, making judgments, when they are alone.</p>
          <p>ISTP’s are action-oriented people. They like to be up and about, doing things. They are
            not people to sit behind a desk all day and do long-range planning. Adaptable and
            spontaneous, they respond to what is immediately before them. They usually have strong
            technical skills, and can be effective technical leaders. They focus on details and practical
            things. They have an excellent sense of expediency and grasp of the details which enables
            them to make quick, effective decisions.</p>
          <p>ISTP’s avoid making judgments based on personal values - they feel that judgments and
            decisions should be made impartially, based on the fact. They are not naturally tuned in
            to how they are affecting others. They do not pay attention to their own feelings, and
            even distrust them and try to ignore them, because they have difficulty distinguishing
            between emotional reactions and value judgments. This may be a problem area for many
            ISTP’s.</p>
          <p>An ISTP who is over-stressed may exhibit rash emotional outbursts of anger, or on the
            other extreme may be overwhelmed by emotions and feelings which they feel compelled
            to share with people (often inappropriately). An ISTP who is down on themselves will
            foray into the world of value judgments - a place which is not natural for the ISTP - and
            judge themselves by their inability to perform some task. They will then approach the
            task in a grim emotional state, expecting the worst.</p>
          <p>ISTP’s are excellent in a crisis situations. They're usually good athletes, and have very
            good hand-eye coordination. They are good at following through with a project, and tying
            up loose ends. They usually don't have much trouble with school, because they are
            introverts who can think logically. They are usually patient individuals, although they
            may be prone to occasional emotional outbursts due to their inattention to their own
            feelings.</p>
          <p>ISTP’s have a lot of natural ability which makes them good at many different kinds of
            things. However, they are happiest when they are centered in action-oriented tasks which
            require detailed logical analysis and technical skill. They take pride in their ability to take
            the next correct step.</p>
          <p>ISTP’s are optimistic, full of good cheer, loyal to their equals, uncomplicated in their
            desires, generous, trusting and receptive people who want no part in confining
            commitments.</p>
