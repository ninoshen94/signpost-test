          <h2>INTP - The giver</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <p>AAs an INTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with
            things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things
            in primarily via your intuition.</p>
          <p>INTP's live in the world of theoretical possibilities. They see everything in terms of how
            it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. They live primarily inside their own
            minds, having the ability to analyze difficult problems, identify patterns, and come up
            with logical explanations. They seek clarity in everything, and are therefore driven to
            build knowledge. They are the "absent-minded professors", who highly value intelligence
            and the ability to apply logic to theories to find solutions. They typically are so strongly
            driven to turn problems into logical explanations, that they live much of their lives within
            their own heads, and may not place as much importance or value on the external world.
            Their natural drive to turn theories into concrete understanding may turn into a feeling of
            personal responsibility to solve theoretical problems, and help society move towards a
            higher understanding.</p>
          <p>INTP’s value knowledge above all else. Their minds are constantly working to generate
            new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories. They approach problems and
            theories with enthusiasm and skepticism, ignoring existing rules and opinions and
            defining their own approach to the resolution. They seek patterns and logical
            explanations for anything that interests them. They're usually extremely bright, and able
            to be objectively critical in their analysis. They love new ideas, and become very excited
            over abstractions and theories. They love to discuss these concepts with others. They may
            seem "dreamy" and distant to others, because they spend a lot of time inside their minds
            musing over theories. They hate to work on routine things - they would much prefer to
            build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation of the system to others.
            They are intensely interested in theory, and will put forth tremendous amounts of time
            and energy into finding a solution to a problem with has piqued their interest.</p>
          <p>INTP’s do not like to lead or control people. They're very tolerant and flexible in most
            situations, unless one of their firmly held beliefs has been violated or challenged, in
            which case they may take a very rigid stance. The INTP is likely to be very shy when it
            comes to meeting new people. On the other hand, the INTP is very self-confident and
            gregarious around people they know well, or when discussing theories which they fully
            understand.</p>
          <p>The INTP has no understanding or value for decisions made on the basis of personal
            subjectivity or feelings. They strive constantly to achieve logical conclusions to
            problems, and don't understand the importance or relevance of applying subjective
            emotional considerations to decisions. For this reason, INTP’s are usually not in-tune
            with how people are feeling, and are not naturally well-equipped to meet the emotional
            needs of others.</p>
          <p>The INTP may have a problem with self-aggrandizement and social rebellion, which will
            interfere with their creative potential. Since their Feeling side is their least developed
            trait, the INTP may have difficulty giving the warmth and support that is sometimes
            necessary in intimate relationships. If the INTP doesn't realize the value of attending to
            other people's feelings, he or she may become overly critical and sarcastic with others. If
            the INTP is not able to find a place for themselves which supports the use of their
            strongest abilities, they may become generally negative and cynical. If the INTP has not
            developed their Sensing side sufficiently, they may become unaware of their
            environment, and exhibit weakness in performing maintenance-type tasks, such as billpaying
            and dressing appropriately.</p>
          <p>For the INTP, it is extremely important that ideas and facts are expressed correctly and
            succinctly. They are likely to express themselves in what they believe to be absolute
            truths. Sometimes, their well thought-out understanding of an idea is not easily
            understandable by others, but the INTP is not naturally likely to tailor the truth so as to
            explain it in an understandable way to others. The INTP may be prone to abandoning a
            project once they have figured it out, moving on to the next thing. It's important that the
            INTP place importance on expressing their developed theories in understandable ways. In
            the end, an amazing discovery means nothing if you are the only person who understands
            it.</p>
          <p>The INTP is usually very independent, unconventional, and original. They are not likely
            to place much value on traditional goals such as popularity and security. They usually
            have complex characters, and may tend to be restless and temperamental. They are
            strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought patterns which allow them to
            analyze ideas in new ways. Consequently, a lot of scientific breakthroughs in the world
            have been made by the INTP.</p>
          <p>The INTP is at his best when he can work on his theories independently. When given an
            environment which supports his creative genius and possible eccentricity, the INTP can
            accomplish truly remarkable things. These are the pioneers of new thoughts in our
            society.</p>
